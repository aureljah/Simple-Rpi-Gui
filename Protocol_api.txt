# STATUS command give the status of the server, which mode is currently active and more information about what is active/runiing in these mode #

STATUS
    # possible responses #:
        200 (LIVE | SCRIPT) 
            LIVE [(input | output)]
                output <pin> <value> <name>
                input <pin> <name>
            SCRIPT # TODO #
            NONE
        500 <error_msg>

Example of response for STATUS:
    200 LIVE
        # mode LIVE active but no output or input is created #
    200 LIVE output 8 1 "my output 1" output 5 0.54 "my LED output 35" input 3 "my input 3"\r\n
        "mode LIVE active with 2 outputs and 1 input"



# LIVE command is used to manage pin in Live mode with set and del #
# Note: LIVE command will delete script mode and activate Live mode if not already active #

LIVE (set | del)
    set (input | output)
        output <pin> <value> "<name>"
        input <pin> "<name>"

            # possible responses #:
                        200 ok
                        500 <error_msg>

    del <pin>

            # possible responses #:
                    200 ok
                    500 <error_msg>

type for LIVE:
    <name> => string
    <pin> => int between 1 and 40
    <value> => int between 0 and 100
    
Example for LIVE:
    LIVE set output 8 100 "my output 1"\r\n
        => will set (or create if needed) the output in pin 8 to value=100 and name="my output 1"
    LIVE set output 5 54 "my LED output 35"\r\n
        => will set (or create if needed) the output in pin 5 to value=54 (PWM is used here) and name="my LED output 35"
    
    LIVE set input 5 "my input"\r\n
        => will set (or create if needed) the input in pin 5 to name="my input"
    LIVE set input 8 "my input"\r\n
        => will set (or create if needed) the input in pin 8 to name="my input 8"
        
    LIVE del 5
        => will delete the output or input which pin=5
